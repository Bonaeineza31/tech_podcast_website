Hi, I'm Sarah, and three years ago I didn't know what HTML stood for.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.000
Today, I'm a frontend developer at a fintech startup in Kigali.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.000
The biggest myth about coding? That you need to be good at math.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.000
Honestly, problem-solving and creativity matter way more.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.000
My advice to girls starting out: build projects you care about.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.000
I built a school fees tracker app, and that portfolio piece got me my first interview.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.000
Don't wait to feel "ready." You'll learn by doing.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.000
Start messy, refine later. That's how we all do it.
