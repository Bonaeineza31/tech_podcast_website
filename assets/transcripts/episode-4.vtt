[TEDx talk] Ngozi Elobuike: How can you build your dream life with AI?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
For a long time, I thought AI was something only for tech giants or researchers.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But during a difficult time in my life, I realized AI could be a personal assistant and a bridge to my goals.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It allows us to automate the mundane and focus on what truly makes us human: creativity and empathy.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Today, I'll show you how to leverage these tools to design a purposeful and innovative life.
