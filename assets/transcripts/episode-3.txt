[00:00] Dr. Jennifer Batamuliza:
I saw the computer and I was like, how do people use this? Like for me it looked magic somehow. So I was like, what does it take maybe to be a computer person?

[00:25] Host:
Welcome to another episode of Her in a Million. Here we are to create a space, actually bring a seat to the table for all young women out there who are hesitant about the tech space. But guess what? We've brought some of the best inspiration, some of the best women in the game to come and tell you their story because they say that experience is the best teacher. So why not get some of the best lived experiences to come and inspire us and of course make sure that every young lady knows that there is a seat at the table for her. Today I am joined by Dr. Jennifer Batamuliza. Make sure to say the doctor because she's worked hard for it. She's a data scientist. She's a lecturer and one of the lead trainers for the African Girls Can Code Initiative. Now, this is not just anyone doing anything because she's making sure that young ladies, young women know that they can get into programming, AI, cyber security, and plenty more. Dr. Jennifer, it is my pleasure to welcome you.

[01:30] Dr. Jennifer Batamuliza:
Pleasure having me here.

[01:32] On Where It All Started
So being in tech it didn't just start five years ago or two years ago. It was a long journey. When I was joining my advanced level I said I want to do math and physics and people are like math and physics is not for women. Are you really going to make it? I'm like yes I will make it. So I did math and physics in high school and the reason why I did math and physics is because I wanted to be a computer engineer and I was told that for you to be a computer engineer you need to understand mathematics and physics.

[02:44] The Moment That Sparked It All
At first I saw a computer. I think that's where my interest was. This was in 2000 — that's when I joined my high school in senior one. I remember going to the school and I saw the computer and this was my first time to see a computer. I saw the computer and I was like how do people use this? Like for me it looked magic somehow. So I was like what does it take maybe to be a computer person. And then I met some people — I can say now I call them my role models. I met one of the friends and she was already pursuing computer courses at the university and then she was like yeah we are doing computer engineering and you can start with math and physics. So I was told for me to be a good computer engineer I need to start studying math. I need to understand math and physics.

[03:58] On Family Background
So to be honest I was born to parents who have been refugees and they just had very basic education. So they couldn't guide me because they didn't know about science. They didn't know about history, about all these things. So for sure I didn't get any guidance from my parents. I just told them I'm going to do this and this and they're like okay, go do it.

[04:55] On What a Platform Like Her in a Million Would Have Meant
I wish this platform existed when I was still young because this I can see that it opens up young people's mind and they can see what is there and they even have some people who are role models to them. So I wish this was there because during my time we didn't get any guidance and I see it as a great opportunity for the young people because it helps these young girls make them understand that they can have that confidence and it also boosts their curiosity and all that. So I wish this platform was there because I can see now it's going to bring a very big change and I can see that in the next 5 years I think we're going to bridge the gender digital gap.

[06:24] For Girls Who Are Not Strong in Math or Physics
For people to be best coders, they really don't have to be very good in mathematics or physics. But then again, tech is wider. They can decide to take a different path like maybe like designer. They can be user interface designers or user experience designers. They do design thinking and nowadays it's even easier. They can even build websites and all that without even knowing how to really code. That's why I say that yes mathematics and physics helped me but then nowadays it's even easier and they don't need those skills for them to thrive in this space.

[07:38] What Is the African Girls Can Code Initiative (AGCCI)?
African Girls Can Code Initiative is a pan-African initiative and this was started by the African Union but then it's being implemented by UN Women partnering with different governments in different countries. So it exists in many countries and Rwanda is one of the countries that is lucky to have the African Girls Can Code Initiative. So the initial training started in 2022 and then 2023 there was the first phase of African Girls Can Code and then 2024 there was another one — the second one — and then now we recently had the third one. So it's implemented by UN Women in Rwanda partnering with the government such as Ministry of ICT, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion. They all come together and other partners such as UNDP, ITU and many other organizations, even nonprofit organizations such as GIS, they all come together to implement this and this benefits girls between the age of 11 and 19. For the first one we had girls who were between 16 and 19 and then for the second phase we had girls who were between 14 and 16 and then now this year we had girls who are between 12 and 15.

[09:27] On Inclusion and Reaching Underserved Communities
The African Girls Can Code Initiative is a big initiative that includes everyone. It includes girls from all different districts of the country. So each district is represented by some girls. And the selection criteria — they don't look at you know there is no any discrimination. So whoever fulfills the criteria they are admitted. So African Girls Can Code Initiative I see it's a very inclusive initiative because it reaches all parts of the country.

[10:53] What Is Taught in AGCCI
Its main objective is to boost the curiosity of the girls, to sparkle the curiosity so that they can even know about tech and see how tech is really good and how tech can take them far. So we teach them different courses. There is coding courses. There is engineering which brings in the part of design and also about electronics where they deal with working with circuits and connecting different devices. And then at the end they solve a problem. So it's a combination. It's about coding. It's about engineering, design and also it goes beyond and even bringing in that gender course and the gender course helps the girls understand their role in the digital economy. So it opens up their eyes and their mind so that they can grab the opportunities.

[12:33] How Dr. Jennifer Got into AI and Cybersecurity
In my bachelor I did computer engineering and information technology and then afterwards when I was about to start my masters I had to go to books and do some research to see what is now trending, what's the hot topic in tech field. Because as you know tech is very wide — you can decide to go with cyber security, you can decide to go with artificial intelligence, you can just decide to be a web developer, you can go the pathway of software engineering. It's a broad area. So when I was joining masters I was like why don't I look at the trending hot topics in tech. So from there, guided by my supervisor, I was like why don't you go the cyber security pathway. So that's how I started and then I went deep into cyber security and it's also broader. I did network security. I also did cryptography and also ethical hacking. For ethical hacking — this is a very simple course and I think any student they really don't need some basic skills to learn about how to hack ethically. And usually on holidays through different organizations I train girls how to hack.

[15:05] On Building Community as a Woman in Tech
For me I think it comes out of passion. I saw the way where I passed and some challenges that I faced. I was like I really need to show the girls the path — like they don't need to struggle like me because I didn't have anyone to show me the way but now I need to clear the path for them. So that's how I started. And then I started bringing people together, building that community so that young girls can come in, they meet mentors, they meet with different people from the industry, people from academia and all that and they can share best practices in tech. So that's how we started with building community. But then again it doesn't end there because we also have some clubs and helping young girls at different schools to form clubs.

[17:00] On Starting a Club — Anyone Can Do It
Starting a club is not like a rocket science. It's just about thinking about it and then having that passion to also help other people become like you and you share even the very little knowledge you have. You don't have to be an expert. You form the club at school or in your community and then afterwards you bring people together and then you start sharing. You don't have to be an expert. You just need to be brave to start it.

[17:30] On Bridging the Gap Between City and Rural Girls
I think this all starts from schools because at school people will meet and they come from different places — others will come from cities, others will come from those remote areas — and when they come together they're studying together then yeah they start sharing the knowledge. So I think it's really great to start from the schools where all those people come together — it's a diverse environment — and then afterwards they start working together and that's where the club comes in. They form the club and then afterwards now they start sharing the knowledge. And another thing I would say is that at school there are different resources. Learning digital skills is one thing but then they also need to have the access to digital devices. And in most schools in Rwanda — you see how Rwanda is really pushing very fast — so you see that different schools, even in rural areas, they have even smart classrooms, they have these laptops, they have computer rooms. So these students can share knowledge where they are — they don't need to wait for the teacher. And another thing is about meeting these people at different places. With the Ministry of ICT and Innovation they have these iHubs in different districts. So all these are great places where these communities can meet and then they learn more about digital skills.

[20:20] The Role of Parents
What I can say here is that the parents they have the key — they can open the opportunities for their girls or they can also close the opportunity for the girls. The kids get to see their parents before they even know about the teachers or go to school. So at the household, at home — you find some parents are like, even it starts with the toys. When they're buying toys, they're like let me buy for my boy a car and they can start to engineer — they open it to see how it is. And for the girls they just have their dolls. So there is that bias that can start at home. What we can tell parents is that the parents are the first people to sparkle the interest of their kids about tech and secondly they are the ones to help the kids gain the confidence. They become their cheerleader and all that. Another thing is about parents — if they are able, they give access to devices. When the kid is exposed to all these digital devices it helps them to gain that confidence even when they grow up and go to school. So I can say the role of the parent is to boost or sparkle the interest of their kid and then give the kid the best environment where they can do whatever they want to explore about tech.

[23:22] What to Tell Skeptical Parents
For those parents I think first of all it's about getting them to change their mindset because most of them when they hear about tech it's like they hear bad things about tech — they just get to know the bad part of it and they don't talk about the good part of it. So if I get a chance to interact with those women, I'll tell them about how now the world is driven by tech and for many young people to thrive in tech they need some skills and they need support from them. So I would ask them to support their kids however they can — they can connect them with other people. In my village where I live many parents they know that I'm a tech person. So they would come to me and say can you talk to our girls? So I'll talk to them. If a parent tries to be part of the journey of their kids it makes it even more easier. And I would also tell them about Her in a Million — tell them about the opportunities they give to girls, these digital online courses. You see many parents — now you know that in Rwanda many people have access to internet and if you check the statistics it's really amazing. So even the parent can also give the phone but of course with supervision and they can do some courses online, those small small courses, or they can watch some of the videos which are related to tech and all that. Some parents just need to also have a change of mindset.

[25:33] Platforms and Resources to Get Started
Here I start with African Girls Can Code. This is one of them and it really helps many girls to get that knowledge in tech. I can also talk about Girls in ICT. We have the Tech Venture, we have Girls in Code, we have She Can Code, we have very many initiatives that help young people and most of them they really help them during the holidays. And then secondly it's about having access to those devices with internet of course if possible and then they can go to internet and try to search for free courses — either Coursera courses and many other courses. We have many free courses online. And we even have very simple text editors that these young people can use — even starting with Scratch. Scratch is an MIT app and it's free. They just need to download it to the device they're using and then afterwards they start coding. For young people there is a way of making coding fun and user friendly. They use some blocks — like if you want to loop, instead of writing a code to loop, they just pick a block that says maybe loop forever. So they just use the small blocks and with those blocks they get to create something. They can solve a problem, they can create a game, they can do animation and all that. I started teaching my kids when they were five using Scratch. And even when programming the robots, they use Scratch codes. You can program it to move, going in front, coming back, doing it, repeating what it's doing and all that. Those are just easy applications that are user friendly for young people. With those applications it can sparkle their interest, their curiosity, and then afterwards now they can start using more advanced text editors — they can use VS Code to code.

[29:51] Barriers Young Women Still Face
First of all I'll talk about these stereotypes and culture — whereby they feel like girls maybe they're just there to do simple simple things, they can't do tech, it's very hard — all that thinking. And then there are just biases. I find it as a very hard challenge and many girls face that. I remember even myself when I was like I want to be a computer engineer and then people are like no you can't manage, and even if you manage to study that, computer people will not hire you because it's a male-dominated field and they feel like women are not that good in that. Secondly it's about — some kids don't have mentors or role models. They don't know someone else who has walked the journey. They need someone to tell them I did it, I was just like you and you can do it. You're very capable. You just need to boost your confidence. You don't have to start as an expert — if you wait to start as an expert then you will not start. All these successful people, they just started. So just start. Those role models and mentors, they can guide young people. Another challenge is that in the curriculum they need to embed more coding courses so that all the students experience that at a very young age and then when they grow up they build their confidence and they have basic skills at the beginning.

[33:28] Encouraging Experienced Women to Mentor
First I think people need to know that they have something to contribute. Like even if you feel like you have nothing to contribute, usually everyone has something to contribute. You could be having skills in networking, in software engineering, in cyber security, in AI and all that and you can pass the same knowledge. I started joining different initiatives and after that I started mentoring many girls and after mentoring them — even right now my mentees are the ones now who are mentoring other young ladies. That's the ripple effect — I train one or I mentor one and they mentor ten and yeah we keep going. So for the women who already have some knowledge in tech — make sure at least they are also mentoring one or two girls. And if we keep passing this then it will reach many women. Everyone needs to be part of Her in a Million — everybody owning it and feeling like they have to contribute to the community. And it's not just about telling them about tech and all that — also talk to them about confidence because if they lack the confidence then they will not even pass that knowledge to others. So we can start small and all of us we can start sharing your knowledge — 100% so we can all be part of Her in a Million.

[36:48] Men as Allies
We keep saying Her in a Million and some of them might think we're just talking to the ladies, but it's all of us — we're also talking to the men, right? Because men have to be our allies in this cause.

[37:00] On Navigating Male-Dominated Spaces
Everywhere I've been working I've been in those male-dominated areas. I remember when I was doing my bachelor degree maybe were about six or seven girls out of sixty in the class. And when I was doing masters in software engineering we were two women out of all — only two. And we had a class of more than 60. And when I was doing PhD the same. And then when I started teaching I would find myself like in the whole department, the whole faculty actually — I see I'm one woman or we are two. And I remember I was once a head of department heading the department of software engineering. So you can imagine I was leading — there were very many male, there was only one one lady, others were all male. So I was heading the department. Why? Because of that confidence and even showing what you know. Even where I'm working now at the University of Rwanda in my department we are just two women. So I've been in all these spaces and it feels so lonely to me. And then when I was talking to other people, other friends, they were saying the same — they are all in this male-dominated field and they feel so lonely because sometimes it's not like that you're working all the time, you also need to talk about hairstyle, where do you go to and all that. You need to have the human aspect of it. And that's how we came to start a nonprofit organization which is called the Rwanda Association for Women in Science and Engineering — RAWIS. I'm the vice president of RAWIS. It has members more than 200 and they all did masters, PhD, postgrad in STEM. Our mission is going to schools, secondary schools and talking to girls and making them join STEM. I will challenge all those women — they have to be part of Her in a Million. They are all STEM women and they all use technology in their different fields. We said let's come together and be together in a space where we are very much confident and at least we socialize a bit. We built the community — more than 200 people. You build that community and then you fight those stereotypes.

[41:02] Best First Steps for a Young Woman Who Wants to Start Now
The best place for her to start is by approaching different people. Wherever you are you could just approach one person. Network and ask them about tech and all that. And secondly they can go to internet because I know nowadays even these young people wherever they are they have connected access to internet. Just going there and then trying to check what are the careers in tech — for me to be in software engineering, what are the courses, what courses am I supposed to do and depending on my level can I start from this stage or this stage. So consulting Google, going to YouTube. And then afterwards they can now start doing some practical things themselves — just as simple as creating a YouTube channel and many other small small things. And then afterwards now they start diving deep into what you want to do. Also joining clubs if they live or are studying where there are clubs like tech clubs. And if they can see an iHub next to them they can go there and learn. And then another one is about the 1 Million Coders — they can join that, they can do the courses and these will boost their skills and make them even more confident.

[44:03] Roadmap by Career Path
They need to approach these different initiatives if they can — that is the African Girls Can Code Initiative, the One Million Coders, Girls in Tech, She Can Code and all that. There they can get to learn more skills and even network with people who are very resourceful to them and they can get people who can guide them towards their career. If you want to be a cyber security expert, a cyber security engineer, you need to start with cyber security courses and ethical hacking courses. If you need to be a software developer, you can be a backend, you can be a frontend — but for that you need to start with web development. And if you are at the basic stage you can start with JavaScript, HTML, CSS and PHP. This one is very easier and many people find it easier to learn. And if they learn those courses afterwards they will dive deep into Java programming — it will end in a career such as a frontend engineer or a backend engineer. For software engineering we have some software courses and we also have database. For you to make an application or a web application or mobile application you need to do those courses and then afterwards you learn database and then you will connect your website or your mobile to the database. And if someone doesn't want to dive very deep into coding they can also do UI/UX where they will learn about design thinking, user experience. With that someone can become a user experience researcher or a user interface engineer. Tech is very wide — they can also be a cloud engineer and many more.

[46:25] How to Narrow Down Your Path
I think it's about knowing what I want to become and then you see what are the skills that will help me get there. And afterwards thinking about who is going to help me, what are the resources, what tools do I need. For me I started by thinking yes I want to be an AI engineer, I want to be a data scientist. For me to become a data scientist where do I start? I can't say I want to be a data scientist or an AI person and I'm not thinking about Python, not thinking about machine learning and all that. So I first asked myself that — for me to get there what are the skills? Which skills do I need? So I had to break it down. To become an AI person I need to study Python programming. I start with basics and then I keep going higher and higher and then I do machine learning and yeah I get there. And if I want to be a data analyst or business analyst — I will start with simple Excel and get to learn how I can play with data in the Excel sheet and then afterwards I get advanced — I say now I'm going to use Power BI and I keep going. So I have to study data analytics for me to be that.

[48:08] Message to Parents
One thing I would tell parents is that we still have a gap in the tech field and as we can see the country is much accelerating towards the digital future and everyone needs to be part of it and there are many opportunities for young people who enter the tech space and they will contribute to the digital economy. So what parents can do is first of all understanding that — we have what we call a leaky pipeline. When starting you'll see the number is big for the girls and as we keep going up — from primary to secondary the number reduces and then when you go to university it reduces more and then when you go to workplace it's even worse. We want parents to help their girls start, get into the pipeline — stay in there and keep advancing their knowledge. So what I would tell parents is first of all creating that safe environment for the girls, giving them an environment with no biases and also boosting the confidence of their girls — telling them they can do anything just the same as boys. Boosting the confidence of their daughters, giving them this space where they can start, they can thrive and also giving them access to devices. Because when we talk about digital skills we won't leave behind digital devices — they will go hand in hand. If they are able to afford it or if they can have access to free spaces where their kids can use the digital equipment, then they can take them and then they start interacting with those. And also tapping into the skills of 1 Million Coders — people all over the country can access that. Help them have access to initiatives like that. They learn the courses, they get to have the confidence, they get the mentorship. And yeah cheering up their kids — whatever small small milestones they cheer them up. If they do that then their kids are going to thrive.

[52:11] Final Message to Young Women
To the young people who are our future leaders in the tech field — for you to be there it starts now. It doesn't start tomorrow. So start it now. And as I've said from the beginning, you don't have to be an expert for you to start working on that problem that solves the community issues. You have all what it takes. You just need to build your confidence and then having the skills and with that it will get you higher. I've seen many girls even here in Rwanda who are working for companies in the US and in all these other different continents because for tech you don't need to be there physically. Girls in Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda — there are many girls who are now working for big tech industries out there and they're working remotely. They just need a digital device — if you have your own laptop and you have access to internet, now you can start working for all those big companies and you get money and you become very independent with your own money. Just have that confidence — don't think there is someone who is better than you. You are very good and you can still build your skills continuously, updating your knowledge, doing short courses for weeks. You can do all these certifications. You can access free courses — Coursera, Harvard, MIT — you'll find it on internet. You really have many opportunities you just need to tap into them. You are lucky because you are even exposed to different initiatives that we weren't exposed to when we were at your age. Here we are talking about Her in a Million, talking about 1 Million Coders, talking about African Girls Can Code, talking about She Can Code — all these opportunities are there for you. It's just about you to explore all those and get the knowledge that you need and thrive. Confidence — that's one thing that will help you reach where you want to be because you are the future tech leaders and you have all what it takes.

[56:54] Host:
Dr. Jennifer, what a journey. First and foremost allow me to give you your flowers and recognize the effort that you put into inspiring young women. Thank you for giving us your time. Thank you for sharing your expertise here and in all the different initiatives that you engage in. I hope that you young ladies, if there's one thing you learned today outside of the fact that there is space for you in the tech space, is that you also have to be part of changing the narrative. If you've learned something, share that knowledge. Share it with the people around you. Start a club. It could start with three of you. Listen, change is one of those — it just takes one bold step. And you've heard her — her whole journey is her taking a bold step from coming from a background that has no knowledge about tech and you just have the confidence of this is what you want to be. You just have to go for it. Her in a Million is here to support you, is here to encourage you. These are stories and lived experiences that we want you to use as a backbone and as a source of encouragement because we want to make sure that her in a million becomes her in a thousand, her in a hundred until we know that that gap is fully closed. We'll be back next time with many more impactful stories for you right here with Her in a Million. Thank you.
