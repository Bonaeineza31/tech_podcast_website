[00:10] Speaker:
What comes to mind when you hear “women in tech”? All I can think of is: rare. Where are they?

[00:25] Speaker:
Too few girls study science, technology, engineering, or maths—the so-called traditional path to a career in tech. And too few women who study anything else end up in a career in tech.

Now, obviously it’s not all doom and gloom. We’ve seen some progress over the last few years, with Deloitte expecting something like 33% of the tech workforce to be female by the end of this year. That’s about a 2% improvement compared to pre-pandemic levels.

We can note that progress, but I don’t think we can be satisfied with it. We need greater gender diversity in the tech sector.

[01:18] Speaker:
So how do we do that? I think we can—and should—break the boxes that we’ve put women and girls in. There are so many of them. They’re outdated. And frankly, they’re annoying and exhausting.

I’ve spent a lot of my own life breaking out of various boxes that I think are still stereotypes—and they prevent women and girls from entering a career in tech. Let me give you a few examples.

[01:52] Speaker:
Let’s take box number one: “Girls are no good at mathematics.” We’ve heard that. We know that saying. And we know that girls, from a very early age, have little confidence in their ability to study mathematics and science.

I have a little confession to make: I absolutely hated mathematics in school. I despised it. But the only way I could actually get away from studying so much maths and focus on what I liked—history and literature—was to make a deal with my parents.

I was allowed to do that, but only if I got a maximum mark in mathematics at the end of my secondary school year when I was 14. So I studied really hard, worked really hard that year, did a lot of mathematics, and I did get the 10 out of 10 in that final exam.

Now what followed… should I say it? The following day, I set up the biggest fire in the courtyard at home and threw all the mathematics books and notebooks straight into it.

Not exactly a picture I would like nowadays on the World Wide Web. But the point is: I could have studied further mathematics, and I could have been good at it—but I chose not to.

[03:32] Speaker:
And that brings me to the second box: “Girls should study something useful to get the job.”

Once I got mathematics out of the way, I focused on what I actually enjoyed studying. That happened to be—five years in school and three years in university—Latin and Ancient Greek.

Yes. Eight years of my life spent on Homer, Cicero, Plato, Caesar… all of that. Is that a good path to a career in tech? Well… questionable.

But what career? Who knows at 18 what it is they’ll end up doing?

[04:28] Speaker:
And that’s box number three: “The only jobs for women in tech are as engineers.”

I left university and decided—like pretty much every other twenty-something—that I wanted to change the world. So I came to Brussels… where better, right? Capital of Europe.

I started working in the European Parliament, and I came across the tech sector. Never in a million years did I think I would end up in a career in tech.

But it turns out STEM education is not the only way to get there. The tech sector is so wide and all-encompassing that more of us need to be involved in its design, its development, and its regulation.

[05:24] Speaker:
It’s everything—from space tech, clean tech, the chips in your cars, the smart meters in your home, the AI, the algorithms, the data.

You may be wondering at this point what it is that I am doing. Let’s just say that, alongside a lot of really talented people, we work on the big questions of our age:

How do we make better use of data without compromising on people’s privacy?
How do we have free and open conversations online, but keep them clean of hate and disinformation?
How do we make it easier for the brightest minds in clean tech to help us solve climate change?

And when everything is online—how do we keep it safe? How do we keep our infrastructure, our elections, our democracy safe and secure?

[06:37] Speaker:
Along this journey, I’ve met activists, entrepreneurs, researchers, regulators, policymakers—an increasing number of whom are women. It turns out you don’t actually need a degree in computer science to work in the tech sector.

I’m very much an accidental woman in tech. I ended up working in technology. I never saw anyone when I was studying—anyone doing what I’m doing today. I wish I had.

I’m no engineer. I didn’t particularly like mathematics. I liked Latin, history, politics, and policymaking—and I ended up in the tech sector. Sometimes I find it fascinating, sometimes scary, often enabling. In many ways, my career chose me—and I ran along with it.

[07:44] Speaker:
So… am I even allowed to call myself a woman in tech? I leave that judgment to you.

But I will say this: tech is too important to leave to the techies. It is not for and about the engineers—it is for and about all of us.

Women in tech are computer scientists, engineers, policymakers, entrepreneurs, journalists, researchers—and at every level, we need more of us.

Because we need diversity of thought and diversity of background to make good tech—and good regulation for tech. And that is why we must do better at making the world of tech as diverse as the societies we live in.
