[TEDx talk] Sabina Ciofu: I am here today to talk about the accidental women in tech.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Tech is often seen as a field only for engineers and computer scientists.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But the truth is, tech is too important to be left just to the techies.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We need lawyers, policymakers, artists, and activists to shape our digital future.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Diversity of thought is our greatest asset in innovation and regulation.
