                        <p><strong>[00:00] Introduction</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Welcome to this TEDxBrussels talk by Sabina Ciofu, exploring the concept of "accidental
                            women in tech"
                            and why diversity in background and thought is essential for effective technology
                            development and policy.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>[00:30] Sabina Ciofu:</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            When we think about women in tech, we often picture computer scientists and software
                            engineers.
                            But women in tech are also lawyers, policymakers, activists, and advocates. We are the
                            "accidental"
                            women in tech—not because we stumbled into this field by chance, but because our paths don't
                            fit
                            the traditional narrative.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>[02:00] Beyond the Stereotype</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            The tech industry has a narrow definition of who belongs. If you're not writing code, you're
                            often
                            not seen as "technical." But policy shapes technology just as much as code does. The
                            regulations
                            we write, the ethical frameworks we establish, the advocacy we do—these all determine how
                            technology
                            impacts society.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>[04:15] The Role of Policy in Tech</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            I work in EU tech policy, focusing on artificial intelligence and digital regulation. My
                            background
                            is in international relations and defense studies, not computer science. Yet I'm deeply
                            embedded in
                            tech because policy and technology are inseparable. We need people who understand both the
                            technical
                            capabilities and the societal implications.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>[06:30] Why Diversity Matters</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Diverse teams build better technology. When only one type of person—one background, one
                            perspective—
                            dominates the conversation, we get blind spots. We build systems that work for some people
                            but fail
                            others. We create AI that reflects existing biases. We design products that exclude entire
                            communities.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>[08:45] The Gentlewomen's Club</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            I founded the Gentlewomen's Club to create space for women in tech policy and digital
                            rights.
                            We're lawyers, researchers, activists, and policymakers. We're proving that you don't need
                            to code
                            to shape the future of technology. Our voices matter. Our expertise matters.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>[11:00] Challenging the Gatekeepers</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            The tech industry has gatekeepers who decide who belongs. They ask, "Can you code?" But they
                            should
                            be asking, "Can you think critically about technology's impact? Can you advocate for ethical
                            AI?
                            Can you write policy that protects people's rights?" These skills are just as technical,
                            just as
                            valuable.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>[13:15] A Call to Action</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            To the women who don't see themselves in the traditional tech narrative: you belong here.
                            Whether
                            you're a lawyer working on data privacy, a researcher studying AI ethics, or an activist
                            fighting
                            for digital rights—you are a woman in tech. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>[15:30] The Future of Tech</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            The future of technology will be shaped by diverse voices. We need computer scientists, yes,
                            but
                            we also need ethicists, policymakers, sociologists, and activists. We need people who ask
                            hard
                            questions about power, fairness, and justice. We need the "accidental" women in tech.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>[17:00] Closing Remarks</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Technology is too important to be left to technologists alone. It affects every aspect of
                            our lives,
                            and everyone should have a say in how it's developed and deployed. So claim your space in
                            tech,
                            whatever your background. The industry needs you.
                        </p>
