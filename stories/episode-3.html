                        <p><strong>[00:00] Introduction</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Welcome to this panel discussion on Women in Tech: Leadership, Resilience & Breaking
                            Barriers.
                            Today's panelists are accomplished leaders who have navigated the challenges of the tech
                            industry
                            and are here to share their insights and experiences.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>[01:00] Moderator:</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Let's start by hearing about your journeys into tech. What drew you to this industry, and
                            what
                            kept you here despite the challenges?
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>[02:00] Panelist 1 - On Getting Started</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            I fell into tech almost by accident. I was studying business, but I took a programming
                            elective
                            and was hooked. The ability to build something from nothing, to solve real problems with
                            code—it
                            was addictive. But staying in tech? That required resilience. Early in my career, I was
                            often
                            the only woman in the room. I had to prove myself over and over again.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>[04:30] Panelist 2 - On Leadership</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Leadership in tech isn't just about technical skills. It's about vision, empathy, and the
                            ability
                            to inspire others. I learned that the hard way. Early on, I thought being the smartest
                            person in
                            the room was enough. But great leaders lift others up. They create environments where
                            everyone
                            can thrive.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>[07:00] Panelist 3 - On Breaking Barriers</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Every barrier I've broken has made me stronger. When I was told I couldn't lead an
                            engineering
                            team because I didn't have a CS degree, I proved them wrong. When I was passed over for
                            promotion
                            because of my gender, I started my own company. Barriers are real, but they're not
                            insurmountable.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>[10:00] On Resilience</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Resilience isn't about never failing. It's about getting back up every time you fall. I've
                            failed
                            more times than I can count—failed projects, failed interviews, failed startups. But each
                            failure
                            taught me something valuable. The key is to learn, adapt, and keep moving forward.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>[13:00] On Mentorship and Sponsorship</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Mentorship changed my life. Having someone who believed in me when I didn't believe in
                            myself—that
                            was transformative. Now I make it a priority to mentor young women in tech. But mentorship
                            isn't
                            enough. We also need sponsorship—people in power who advocate for us, who open doors, who
                            give us
                            opportunities.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>[16:00] On Work-Life Balance</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Let's be honest: work-life balance in tech is hard. The industry glorifies overwork. But
                            burnout
                            is real, and it's not sustainable. I've learned to set boundaries, to prioritize my
                            well-being,
                            and to build a support system. It's okay to say no. It's okay to take breaks. Your worth
                            isn't
                            measured by how many hours you work.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>[18:30] Advice for Aspiring Women in Tech</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            First, believe in yourself. Imposter syndrome is real, but you belong here. Second, find
                            your
                            community. Surround yourself with people who support and challenge you. Third, don't be
                            afraid
                            to take risks. The biggest opportunities often come from stepping outside your comfort zone.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>[20:00] On the Future of Women in Tech</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            I'm optimistic. More women are entering tech than ever before. More companies are
                            prioritizing
                            diversity and inclusion. More leaders are recognizing that diverse teams build better
                            products.
                            We still have a long way to go, but the momentum is building. The future is bright.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>[21:30] Closing Remarks</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Thank you to our incredible panelists for sharing their wisdom and experiences. To everyone
                            watching: you have the power to shape the future of tech. Use it wisely.
