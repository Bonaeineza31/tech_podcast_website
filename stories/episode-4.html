                            <p><strong>[00:00] Ngozi Elobuike:</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                Five years ago, I was at my absolute rock bottom. I was sleeping on a floor, I had no
                                direction, and I felt like the world had moved on without me. But today, I stand
                                before you as a global AI strategist. And the bridge between that floor and this
                                stage was a decision to reclaim my life using the most powerful tool of our time:
                                Artificial Intelligence.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>[02:00] The AI Revolution is Personal</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                We often talk about AI in terms of big corporations or robots taking jobs. But AI is
                                fundamentally a personal productivity tool. It's a way to augment your own intelligence,
                                your own creativity, and your own physical capacity to do work. When I started
                                learning about AI, I didn't see it as a threat—I saw it as my ticket out.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>[04:30] Designing Your Life</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                Design thinking isn't just for products—it's for people. By using AI tools, you can
                                prototype your career, you can learn complex subjects in half the time, and you can
                                automate the mundane tasks that keep you from your true passion. I used AI to help me
                                research, to help me structure my business ideas, and to help me stay ahead of trends
                                that others were just starting to notice.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>[07:00] Overcoming the Fear of Tech</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                Many people are paralyzed by the fear that tech is too hard or moving too fast. But
                                tech is a language, and like any language, you start with the alphabet. You don't
                                need to be a coder to be an AI strategist. You need to be a critical thinker. You
                                need to know how to ask the right questions—to prompt the technology to give you
                                the results you need.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>[09:15] Building Your Dream Life</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                Your dream life isn't something that happens to you; it's something you build. And in
                                the 21st century, AI is the hammer and the nails. Whether you want to be an artist, an
                                entrepreneur, or a scientist, AI can amplify your voice and your impact. It allows
                                small teams—or even individuals—to compete with giants.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>[11:00] Closing Thoughts</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                Don't let the future scare you. Let it inspire you. The tools are here, they are
                                accessible, and they are waiting for you to pick them up. From rock bottom to the
                                clouds, you have the power to design your journey. Pick up the tool, start
                                experimenting, and build the life you've always dreamed of.
