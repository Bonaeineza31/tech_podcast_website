            <p><strong>[00:00] Introduction</strong></p>
            <p>
              Welcome to this panel discussion from the TIME Women of the Year Leadership Forum in Los Angeles.
              Today, three remarkable women leaders in business discuss the growing role of new technologies,
              particularly artificial intelligence, in shaping our future.
            </p>

            <p><strong>[00:30] Moderator - Alice Park (TIME Senior Correspondent):</strong></p>
            <p>
              Thank you all for being here. Let's start with a fundamental question: How is AI transforming
              the way you approach business leadership today?
            </p>

            <p><strong>[01:00] Panel Discussion - The Role of AI in Business</strong></p>
            <p>
              AI has fundamentally changed how we think about decision-making. It's not about replacing human
              judgment, but augmenting it. We're using AI to analyze patterns we couldn't see before, to predict
              market trends, and to personalize customer experiences at scale. The key is ensuring we're
              building these systems with diverse perspectives from the start.
            </p>

            <p><strong>[02:15] On Leveling the Playing Field</strong></p>
            <p>
              What's exciting is how AI can democratize access to powerful tools. Small businesses now have
              capabilities that were once only available to large corporations. But we must be mindful of
              ethical implications. As women in tech, we have a responsibility to ensure these technologies
              are developed inclusively and don't perpetuate existing biases.
            </p>

            <p><strong>[03:45] Addressing the Talent Gap</strong></p>
            <p>
              The talent gap is real. We're seeing unprecedented demand for AI skills, but not enough women
              entering these fields. That's why mentorship and representation matter. When young women see
              us in these roles, it changes what they believe is possible for themselves.
            </p>

            <p><strong>[05:00] Advice for Women Interested in Tech</strong></p>
            <p>
              Start where you are. You don't need a computer science degree to contribute to tech. Some of
              the most important roles in AI development are in ethics, policy, user experience, and business
              strategy. Find your unique angle and lean into it. Build your network—communities of women in
              tech are crucial. The support system makes all the difference.
            </p>

            <p><strong>[07:00] On Taking Action</strong></p>
            <p>
              Don't wait for permission. If you have an idea, pursue it. If you want to learn something, start
              learning. The barrier to entry has never been lower. Free courses, open-source projects, and
              communities are eager to help newcomers. Your perspective as a woman brings value that the
              industry desperately needs.
            </p>

            <p><strong>[08:30] Looking to the Future</strong></p>
            <p>
              There's reason for hope. More women are starting tech companies, reaching C-suite positions,
              and the conversation has shifted from "why diversity matters" to "how do we achieve it."
              The next generation is growing up with technology as a natural part of their lives—they're
              not asking if they belong in tech, they're assuming they do. That confidence is powerful.
            </p>

            <p><strong>[10:30] Systemic Change</strong></p>
            <p>
              We're seeing real progress. Companies are being held accountable for diversity metrics.
              Investors are asking questions about inclusive hiring. Schools are rethinking how they teach
              computer science. It's not perfect, but the momentum is building.
            </p>

            <p><strong>[11:15] Closing Remarks</strong></p>
            <p>
              Thank you to our incredible panelists for sharing their insights. The future of technology
              is being shaped by diverse voices, and these women are leading the way.
            </p>
