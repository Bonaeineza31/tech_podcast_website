              <p><strong>[00:00] Moderator:</strong></p>
              <p>
                I am thrilled to be here with this group of incredible women who are shaping the future of business with
                the smart
                decisions they’re making about innovation. As we saw in the video, technology is forcing businesses to
                change or risk
                being left behind—and I think that’s especially true in consumer-focused businesses like the ones each
                of you runs.
              </p>
              <p>
                But you can’t embrace every new thing that comes along, as much as you’d like to. So I thought we’d
                start with this:
                how do you evaluate advances—new services and technologies like AI—and decide which ones are must-dos
                and which ones
                you can take a pass on? Debbie, let’s start with you.
              </p>

              <p><strong>[00:46] Debbie:</strong></p>
              <p>
                Sure. That’s a great question—especially these days. It feels like a fire hose of technological
                advancement. And we
                just heard that quote: if you don’t embrace it, if you don’t adopt it, you might be left behind. That’s
                very much the
                ethos many of us on stage feel.
              </p>
              <p>
                At OpenTable, we evaluate technology by starting with our mission: we’re here to serve restaurants. We
                help them run
                their businesses more productively and more efficiently. Restaurants matter in all of our communities—so
                when we look
                at technology, the question becomes: does adopting this help restaurants? Does it help them get answers
                faster—like
                through customer support? Does it help them do manual tasks faster, so they can focus on the guest?
              </p>
              <p>
                So we ask: what are our North Stars as a business? Does this technology help our restaurants? And on the
                consumer side,
                does it help our diners too? We have a wealth of information about dining behavior, and AI can help us
                process that
                data and personalize experiences—so when you open OpenTable, it understands your preferences and
                context.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ultimately, what we invest in comes back to: is it helping our restaurants, and is it helping our
                diners?
              </p>

              <p><strong>[02:32] Leslie:</strong></p>
              <p>
                I’d add one thing. We operate a lot of online travel companies. When this technology burst onto the
                scene, we ran and
                said, “We need to build a product for our customers right now.” So we did—but then we noticed adoption
                wasn’t high.
              </p>
              <p>
                What customers told us was: “Thanks for offering this GenAI tool, but I don’t like that one as much.”
                That was a really
                important learning for us: it’s not tech for the sake of tech. It’s about what actually adds value.
              </p>
              <p>
                One practical example: in customer service, agents often have to write summaries of what happened. That
                takes time. We
                deployed GenAI to write those summaries, and it reduced customer service time significantly. But that
                worked because it
                solved a real problem—not because we assumed customers “should want” it.
              </p>

              <p><strong>[03:33] Padma:</strong></p>
              <p>
                I’ve been in the tech industry for decades, and there’s always a lifecycle with new technology. Early
                on, everyone is
                fascinated—it’s the “hype cycle.” People talk about it, everyone wants to try it, but there’s also risk.
                Then the
                technology matures, and it becomes truly useful.
              </p>
              <p>
                So when a business evaluates technology, timing matters. In addition to choosing what’s right for your
                business, you
                have to ask: when is the right time? If you can benefit early and you’re comfortable taking some risk,
                you should be an
                early adopter. If not, it’s okay to be a fast follower. Not everyone needs to jump on every new
                technology right away.
              </p>
              <p>
                With AI right now, we’re in a hype cycle because progress is happening so quickly, and it’s powerful—but
                it also brings
                risks. And we should distinguish between AI and GenAI: they’re different. GenAI creates content—text,
                videos, music—and
                it can carry biases from training data. That means we have to be careful, especially in consumer-facing
                businesses.
              </p>

              <p><strong>[05:56] Moderator:</strong></p>
              <p>
                Quick check—how many people here have booked a restaurant on OpenTable? (Hands.) That warms my
                heart—thank you.
                And how many have planned a trip on Booking.com? (Hands.) Great.
              </p>
              <p>
                I want to come back to something you mentioned, Leslie. You said when you offered AI-based
                services—especially in travel,
                where you’d think an AI assistant could easily recommend destinations—people were reluctant to adopt it.
                Why?
              </p>

              <p><strong>[07:00] Leslie:</strong></p>
              <p>
                I think in general, if something works today, customers don’t necessarily want to change. Many travelers
                have a comfort
                pattern in how they book travel, and the technology isn’t fully there yet.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re a global company, so there are privacy considerations and different regulations around the world.
                Also, we’re not
                necessarily the company building our own large language model—we’ll work with partners. There are real
                questions about
                how and where customer data is shared, and we take that very seriously.
              </p>
              <p>
                The potential is game-changing, but we’re still early. That said, we may be entering a moment where this
                technology
                becomes more accessible than initially expected—not just limited to the biggest tech players. That could
                unlock a wave
                of entrepreneurs building applications on top of major platforms, which accelerates innovation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Think of it like this: Uber couldn’t exist until smartphones existed. We might be at a similar stage
                now—and as the
                ecosystem matures, consumer products will get much better.
              </p>

              <p><strong>[08:32] Moderator:</strong></p>
              <p>
                Debbie—when you’ve been adopting AI at OpenTable, what surprises came up—positive or negative?
              </p>

              <p><strong>[08:46] Debbie:</strong></p>
              <p>
                We’re still in the process, but one point is important: the AI alternative has to be better. People
                already have a way
                of doing things—travel research, dining choices—and they need to trust that AI can do it better, and
                understand how it’s
                doing it.
              </p>
              <p>
                On our side, we’ve used AI a lot in customer service to improve productivity. And we’re about to launch
                free-form search
                on the consumer side. Imagine searching: “I want a restaurant in Santa Monica that’s kid-friendly, has
                gluten-free
                options, and is near the ocean.” That kind of search should work.
              </p>

              <p><strong>[11:44] Padma:</strong></p>
              <p>
                We connect great stories with people—stories you’ll love. So the problem you described in restaurants
                exists in content
                too: how do we know what someone will like, with precision?
              </p>
              <p>
                At our company, we use AI mostly for discovery—helping people find the right book, show, or movie, and
                connecting them
                to communities with shared interests. We don’t believe technology should replace human creativity. We
                call ourselves a
                tech company with the soul of an artist. AI should empower humans to create more, and better.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have an AI agent called Scout—named after Scout Finch—who helps users search in deeper ways, not just
                genre-based.
                People can ask for specific things like: “a romance novel set in Paris in the 1920s with a strong female
                character.”
              </p>
              <p>
                We also use AI for “utility” features—tracking what you read, what you liked, what you didn’t finish,
                and why. Those
                patterns help personalize recommendations.
              </p>
              <p>
                GenAI is more difficult. We had a negative experience where GenAI created reader summaries that were
                hurtful to some
                users. Even if you generate millions of summaries and only one is wrong, that one can still harm
                someone. That’s why we
                need diverse teams testing these systems, especially for global audiences.
              </p>

              <p><strong>[16:07] Moderator:</strong></p>
              <p>
                That leads to the next question: AI can feel impersonal. Travel and food are deeply personal. How do you
                use AI—both
                AI and GenAI—while keeping the human touch and trust intact? Leslie?
              </p>

              <p><strong>[16:38] Leslie:</strong></p>
              <p>
                We have to be cautious that we’re delivering something truly useful, and not something that breaks
                trust. We work with a
                test-and-learn mindset: we run a lot of A/B experiments, test on small subsets of customers, and learn
                from reactions.
                If it doesn’t work, we go back to the drawing board.
              </p>

              <p><strong>[17:24] Moderator:</strong></p>
              <p>
                Debbie—nothing more personal than eating preferences, right?
              </p>

              <p><strong>[17:29] Debbie:</strong></p>
              <p>
                It’s true. I think of AI and GenAI as a way to increase personalization—especially for diners. We have
                information about
                dining habits, and AI can help stitch it together better: recommending restaurants based on past
                behavior and ratings,
                and even understanding different contexts—like dining with friends versus dining with kids.
              </p>

              <p><strong>[18:36] Padma:</strong></p>
              <p>
                There’s also a difference between recommendations and discovery. Recommendations use past behavior, and
                AI is good at
                that. Discovery is more serendipitous—like browsing a bookstore and finding something unexpected. AI’s
                next potential is
                to surface things you haven’t thought of yet—hyper-personalization.
              </p>
              <p>
                But we also have to balance hyper-personalization with privacy: how much data should be exposed to reach
                that level of
                understanding?
              </p>
              <p>
                For us, technology should strengthen human connection—not replace it. We use AI to connect people with
                real communities,
                so humans can recommend stories to each other. You find people who like similar things, and that creates
                meaningful
                connection.
              </p>

              <p><strong>[21:25] Moderator:</strong></p>
              <p>
                Two quick topics: women’s leadership in tech and bias in AI. What lessons or solutions do you want to
                share to ensure AI
                doesn’t reinforce inequity? Leslie?
              </p>

              <p><strong>[21:58] Leslie:</strong></p>
              <p>
                My advice: don’t leave this to your CTO. This is game-changing technology, like the internet was. It
                will touch
                everybody. Every department should have objectives related to technology, and this is an opportunity for
                women—no matter
                where they sit in an organization—to be at the forefront.
              </p>

              <p><strong>[22:41] Debbie:</strong></p>
              <p>
                I was recently on a call with other CEOs, and I was the only woman. The conversation was about who could
                help them
                understand AI—and everyone said, “We need someone connected in Silicon Valley.”
              </p>
              <p>
                I live in the Bay Area. I went to Stanford and MIT. OpenTable is involved in many AI-related launches.
                And yet no one
                thought to consider me. And honestly—I didn’t raise my hand either.
              </p>
              <p>
                That taught me something: we have to package and market ourselves differently. I want to be considered.
                That’s not on
                them—it’s on me. So my takeaway is: position yourself, raise your hand, and step into the tech
                conversation.

              <p>
                Technology is created by humans, so it carries our biases—racial bias, gender bias. The output is only
                as good as the
                input, and the input data is often contaminated. It’s common sense.
              </p>
              <p>
                As leaders, it’s our responsibility to ensure there’s a human in the loop—especially in customer-facing
                systems like
                support. And we need diverse teams developing and testing these solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also need to share failures. We made mistakes with GenAI, and I spoke publicly about them so other
                entrepreneurs
                could avoid the same problems. That’s how the technology improves.
              </p>

              <p>
                I could keep going, but we’ll wrap here. Leslie, Debbie, and Padma—thank you for sharing your insights.
                It’s clear we
                have a lot to look forward to.
